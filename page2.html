                        I really love you soo much, Sarayu. You are the most beautiful, gorgeous, prettiest girl ever. And thank you for always being honest and transparent with me at times, even when sometimes its hurtful to say it, i really adore you for it. I appreciate the fact that you are in my life now. I don’t think you know how much special you are to me, the way you laughh, OMGGG, its literally hands down the most soothing thing. Every single you talk with me, it just feels so refreshing, its almost as if I’m alive.

Monna mi intiki ocha ga, akkada you left you hair down and atu etu you were doing it like up nd down, felt like it was in slow motion, like the time has been paused.

                        My words never feel enough to appreciate you, Sarayuu. Every small thing you say stays on mind without even trying to remember it. You deserve to know how beautiful you are everyday, and sometimes I just sit and look at your pictures and be like damn, she is the most gorgeous girl ever, i can’t believe she loves me back too. You make me the happiest person and also the saddest person too, but hey! i guess everything comes at a price yk, please be more gentle with me, thanks.

                        I guess Some people walk into your life quietly and change everything without even trying, and you are that person. i wish to be the same person in your life too, just like you are to me, and I think it’s time I finally ask you .
